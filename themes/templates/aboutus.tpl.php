					<h1 class="pageheading">About the ENBR (El Nuevo Bantay Radyo)</h1>
					<p>
    DYDD EL Nuevo Bantay Radyo is one of the many local AM stations here in Cebu City. The station's new office in Escario St. has housed at least 37 employees including those field technicians and engineers who were assigned at the transmitter site. 
	<br>
	<br>Founded and operated in 1995 by the Siam Broadcasting which is presently based in Cagayan de Oro City. Today, the station hosts 2 relaying stations namely DYHH in Bogo, Cebu and DYZZ in Guihulngan, Negros Oriental. The relaying stations have program formats the same as the host station - the DYDD. Due to the demands, the station will extend its operation launching another sister station in Davao City next year. <br><br>The station coexists through the management of the Lacto-PAFI Corporation, dealers of health drinks, owned and managed by Engr. Gregorio Sanchez. The Lacto PAFI products had been a constant client of the station but it has also served small to big scale establishments for its advertisement needs. 					</p>
